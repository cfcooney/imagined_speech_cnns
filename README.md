# imagined_speech_cnns
Data processing, network architectures, statistics and visualization pertaining to the use of convolutional neural networks
for feature extraction and classification of imagined speech EEG recordings. A nested cross-validation technique has been employed 
to validate certain hyper-parameters. The performance of the CNNs is validated against classification obtained using a SVM with
mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as features.
